## Basic Usage
To get an overview of the basic CLI capabilities of `Chessli`, take a look at this short demo video I
created (click on the image below to watch on youtube):

There is also a short video showing the `chessli`s Anki cards in action:

:information_source: I am in the midst of creating a comprehensive documentation that will be released with version 0.2.

Until then you can take a look at the [CLI documentation](docs/cli.md), or programmatically ask it questions:

**Examples**:

- Getting general help for `chessli`:

```console
chessli --help 
```
- Getting help for individual `chessli` commands:

```console
chessli games --help 
```

- You can add a create a file `configs/lichess.user` and put your user name in it.
- Then it will be used as default username in place of mighty `DrNykterstein`.
