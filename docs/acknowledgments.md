## Acknowledgments

- **Lichess**:
  - A free, no-ads, open source chess server that let's everyone play chess!
  - I truly love it.
  - Think about whether to [become a patron](https://lichess.org/patron)! :)
- **Anki**:
  - A free and open-source flashcard program using spaced-repetition, a technique from cognitive science for fast and long-lasting memorization.
  - I couldn't imagine learning without it anymore.
- **Anki Cards Design**
  - The interactive chess functionality on the cards is taken from [these fantastic cards](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1082754005).
  - You can find a great video about those cards [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxSP1YkfD0k&feature=youtu.be).
- **Further Awesome Tools**:
  - Most of the heavy lifting, e.g. parsing games, finding mistakes, extracting openings, etc. is done with `python-chess`.
  - The communication between `lichess` and `chessli` is done via `berserk`.
  - The CLI is built with `typer`.
  - The rich colors are made possible with `rich`.
  - The `apy` tool is used to programmatically import the chess knowledge into Anki.
  - **You should really check those tools out; each and everyone one of them is amazing.**
